Hear ye', hear ye'!

Please submit pull requests to add your template examples here. These can be literal examples, or an .md with links to a publically accessible location.

If we can collect a few things over here, we can submit a structured pull request for [Network Automation Forum (NAF)'s HandyInfo](https://handyinfo.networkautomation.forum/)! Afterwards, each of us can make any further submissions on our own behalfs directly to their [Github](https://github.com/Network-Automation-Forum/handyinfo). This is an opportunity to contribute to the global network automation community.
