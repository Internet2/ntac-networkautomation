## Agenda

- Welcome!
    - Agenda Bash
- Short history and open discussion on how we want to structure this SIG.
- Open call for goals.
    - What are you excited to get out of this SIG and/or monthly?
    - What is important to you?
- (We will do last) Open call for network automation stories.
    - Share tools youâ€™ve enjoyed using.
    - Share successful or unsuccessful use-cases in automation.
    - Share anything you want!

### Added Agenda Items    
- would like to hear how others are using automation for routing security
    - for example maintaining IRR records, checking ROAs, etc.
    - (AJ Ragusa) GlobalNOC is working on automating parts of this. Steve Wallace (Internet2) to reach out.
- Is anyone using automation for documentation (diagrams?) or data hygiene (i.e. standardizing interface descriptions)?
    - Some leverage CDP/LLDP to update/validate interface descriptions
    - Example tools/processes: Scrapli+Python
- What is the toolbox everyone likes to use, Python and... Libraries and methods (Yang models vs CLI commands)
- Interested to hear what people are using and how they are solving problems in their networks.
- Are people looking at how to do network validation with tools like batfish?
    - UArizona used batfish for initial prefix population in NetBox https://joelmcguire1.medium.com/building-a-new-ipam-system-using-netbox-and-batfish-ad1e91ff3503 
- How are groups staffing up for automation?  WHat's the balance between network engineers and automation engineers? Any special training classes or highlights?
    - Karl: Internet2 has dedicated Information Systems and Services team (ISS). Keys to success: No discrete teams, all are NetDevOps, high communication. "Build One Team". Put trained developers.
    - "Need to integrate the [engineering and development] teams"
    - "Teaching network engineers to develop software, and teaching software developers to network engineers, neither is easier"
    - (Training) Kirk Byers network automation python courses
    - (Workshop) I2 Getting Started with Automation Workshop https://internet2.edu/2023-internet2-community-exchange/registration/#workshops

### Items deferred due to time constraints
- How does everyone handle network engineers who code versus an exprienced developer? It's easy to write a script but how do we roll full blown automation solutions that are easy to maintain. Similar to above^^^
- What metrics are organizations using to justify the resources needed to implement automation?
- Additional items mentioned [below](#desired-sig-goals-anyone-can-add-to-this-list)

## Meeting Notes

### Desired SIG Goals (anyone can add to this list!)
- Learn about what tools other institutions are using
- Learn about what parts of their network are prioritized for automation, if any.
- Interested in the How to get started , establishing SSOT's, what are simple ways to get started. What are most common items people have in their SSOT
- Learn from groups who are using Nautobot SSOT features
What are people doing to help get existing network engineers excited about using automation instead of logging into each router / switch to manage? +1
- Scalable ways to integrate/audit SoT(s) (dcim/ipam) with actual configuration data
- How do you test to verify configuration before deployments

I believe also collecting links to activities folks are willing to share would help contribute to https://github.com/Internet2/ntac-networkautomation +1


### Interesting Tools
- "Scrapli" - https://pypi.org/project/scrapli/
- D2 Lang -https://d2lang.com/tour/intro/ - diagram scripting language - could possibly be used to automate diagramming (I've noticed there are integrations for this appearing everywhere)
- Batfish - https://www.batfish.org/ - open source network analysis tool
- D3 JS - https://d3js.org/ - Javascript library for visualizations
- eNMS - https://www.enms.io/ - open source network automation software
- Arista Cloudvision - https://www.arista.com/en/cg-cv/cv-introduction-to-cloudvision - commercial network orchestration and workflow automation
